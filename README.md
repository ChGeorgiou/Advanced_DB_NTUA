### System Installation
To install the required software and set up the systems we followed the instructions provided at this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pjf3Q6T-Ak2gXzbgoPpvMdfOHd1GqHZG?usp=sharing#scrollTo=I0jwIL1Ba-DU).

To connect to Okeanos-Knossos VMs we used the *[Visual Studio Code Remote - SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh)*.
After the above steps are completed, you can start testing. You will have to install any missing Python libraries manually.

### Data Preparation
To perform the requested changes on data run [data_preparation.py](./data_preparation.py). Data in their final form are then stored in HDFS.

### Queries
All requested queries can be found in the [queries](./queries) directory.

### Output
All queries' outputs can be found in the [results](./results) directory. They were initially stored in HDFS and were then copied manually to the local file system.

### Assignment Report
Our report can be found [here](./el19027_el19102_AdvDB_Report.pdf).
